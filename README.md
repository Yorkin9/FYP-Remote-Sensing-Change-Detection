# FYP-Remote-Sensing-Change-Detection
This project is dedicated to Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) task, based on the powerful Segment Anything Model (SAM) architecture, and is improved and lightened for the characteristics of remote sensing field, in order to adapt the heterogeneous images inputs(e.g., RGB，multispectral, SAR，etc.)
